# GameSenseTeamSideSkinChanger
A lua script to add CT and T sided skinchanger


Notes: 
1. You chaneg to wrong skin if you change weapons back and forth to fast
2. You update skins by changing weapons
3. Reloading scripts can break things to fix everything just load your config after
4. Sometimes the skinchanger breaks (you will know by clicking the skin changer tab and there being no skins) You need to restartgame and reinject :(.

Thanks to Aviarita, sapphyrus and NMChris for answering my stupid questions and teaching me things such as nested tables.
